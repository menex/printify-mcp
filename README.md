## Overview

The Printify MCP Server is a bridge between AI assistants (like Claude) and Printify's print-on-demand platform. It allows AI assistants to create and manage print-on-demand products, generate designs using AI, and handle all aspects of product management through the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

MCP is an open standard developed by Anthropic that standardizes how applications provide context to Large Language Models (LLMs). This server implements the MCP specification to expose Printify's functionality to AI assistants in a structured way.

## Features

This MCP server provides the following capabilities:

### Printify API Integration

- **Authentication**: Initialize the Printify API client with your API key
- **Shops**: List and manage Printify shops
- **Products**: Create, read, update, delete, and publish products
- **Catalog**: Browse blueprints, print providers, and variants
- **Images**: Upload images to use in product designs

### AI Image Generation

- **Replicate Integration**: Generate images using Replicate's Flux 1.1 Pro model
- **Combined Workflow**: Generate images with AI and upload them directly to Printify in one step

### Documentation

- **In-Tool Documentation**: Comprehensive documentation for all aspects of product creation
- **Workflow Guidance**: Step-by-step guides for creating products

### Prompts

- **Generate Product Description**: Generate compelling product descriptions based on product details

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v18 or higher)
- npm (v7 or higher)
- Printify API key
- Replicate API token (for AI image generation)

## Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/tsavo/printify-mcp.git
cd printify-mcp

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Build the project
npm run build
```

## Configuration

You have two options for configuring the environment variables needed by the server:

### Option 1: Using a .env File (Recommended)

1. Create a `.env` file in the root directory of the project with the following variables:

```
# Required for all functionality
PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key

# Optional: If not provided, the first shop in your account will be used
PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id

# Optional: Only needed if you want to use image generation features
REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
```

You can use the `.env.example` file as a template by copying it:

```bash
cp .env.example .env
# Then edit the .env file with your actual API keys
```

### Option 2: Using System Environment Variables

Alternatively, you can set these variables directly in your system environment:

**Windows (Command Prompt):**
```cmd
:: Required
set PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key

:: Optional
set PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id

:: Optional - only for image generation
set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
```

**Windows (PowerShell):**
```powershell
# Required
$env:PRINTIFY_API_KEY = "your_printify_api_key"

# Optional
$env:PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID = "your_shop_id"

# Optional - only for image generation
$env:REPLICATE_API_TOKEN = "your_replicate_api_token"
```

**macOS/Linux:**
```bash
# Required
export PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key

# Optional
export PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id

# Optional - only for image generation
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
```

The server will check for these environment variables at startup, regardless of whether they're set in a `.env` file or in the system environment.

### Getting a Printify API Key

1. Log in to your Printify account
2. Go to Settings > API
3. Click "Create New API Key"
4. Copy the API key and add it to your `.env` file

### Getting a Replicate API Token

1. Create an account on [Replicate](https://replicate.com/)
2. Go to your account settings
3. Generate an API token
4. Copy the token and add it to your `.env` file

## Usage

### Starting the Server

```bash
npm start
```

This will start the MCP server using the stdio transport, which allows it to communicate with MCP clients like Claude Desktop. The server will automatically initialize the Printify API client using the API key from the environment variable.

### Development Mode

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start the server in development mode with automatic reloading when files change.

## Using with Claude Desktop

There are three ways to use this MCP server with Claude Desktop:

### Option 1: Install from npm (Recommended)

1. Install the package globally:
   ```bash
   npm install -g @tsavo/printify-mcp
   ```

2. Configure your environment variables using either a `.env` file in your current directory or system environment variables as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

3. Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Settings > MCP Servers
   - Click "Add Server"
   - Enter a name for the server (e.g., "Printify MCP")
   - Select "Command" as the transport type
   - Enter `printify-mcp` as the command
   - No arguments are needed
   - Click "Add Server"

4. Test the connection by asking Claude to check the Printify status:
   ```
   Can you check the status of my Printify connection?
   ```

   The `printify-mcp` command runs the same code as the original index.ts file, but packaged as an executable that can be run directly from the command line.

### Option 2: Use with npx

If you don't want to install the package globally, you can use npx:

1. Configure your environment variables as described in the [Configuration](#configuration) section.

2. Configure Claude Desktop:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Settings > MCP Servers
   - Click "Add Server"
   - Enter a name for the server (e.g., "Printify MCP")
   - Select "Command" as the transport type
   - Enter `npx` as the command
   - Enter `@tsavo/printify-mcp` as the arguments
   - Click "Add Server"

### Option 3: Use Docker (Recommended for Isolation)

If you prefer to run the server in a Docker container, you have two options:

#### Option 3A: Use the Docker Image Directly from Docker Hub

2. Create a directory for your Printify MCP files:
   ```bash
   mkdir printify-mcp
   cd printify-mcp
   ```

3. Create a `.env` file with your API keys:
   ```
   PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_printify_api_key
   PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id (optional)
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_api_token
   ```

4. Create a temp directory for temporary files:
   ```bash
   mkdir temp
   ```

5. Run the Docker container (two options):

   **Option A: Using environment variables directly (Recommended)**
   ```bash

### Testing the Connection

In a conversation with Claude, you can test if the server is working by asking Claude to check the Printify status:

```
Can you check the status of my Printify connection?
```

Claude should use the `get-printify-status` tool to check the connection status. You can also ask Claude to list your Printify shops using the `list-shops` tool.

If you encounter any issues:

1. Check the console output where you started the server for error messages
2. Verify that your environment variables are set correctly
3. Make sure the server is still running
4. Confirm that the path to the server in Claude Desktop is correct

## Setting Up API Keys

### Printify API Key

To use the Printify features of this MCP server, you'll need a Printify API key. Here's how to get one and set it up:

1. Log in to your Printify account at [printify.com](https://printify.com/app/login)
2. Go to My Profile > Connections
3. In the Connections section, you can generate your Personal Access Tokens
4. Store your API key securely, as it will only be visible immediately after generation
5. Create a `.env` file in the project root with the following content:

   ```
   PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   # Optional: Set a default shop ID
   # PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=your_shop_id_here

   # For image generation with Replicate
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token_here
   ```

   The server will automatically initialize the Printify API client using the API key from the environment variable. If you don't specify a shop ID, the server will use the first shop in your account as the default.

   You can also set the environment variables directly:

   ```bash
   # On Windows
   set PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   set REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token_here
   npm start

   # On macOS/Linux
   export PRINTIFY_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
   export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=your_replicate_token_here
   npm start
   ```

### Replicate API Token

To use the image generation features of this MCP server, you'll need a Replicate API token. Here's how to get one:

1. Create an account or log in at [replicate.com](https://replicate.com)
2. Go to your account settings
3. Generate an API token
4. Add the token to your `.env` file as shown above

## Workflow Examples

## Architecture

### Main Components

The Printify MCP server consists of three main components:

1. **MCP Server (`src/index.ts`)**: Sets up the MCP server with various tools for interacting with Printify's API.
2. **Printify API Client (`src/printify-api.ts`)**: Handles communication with Printify's API using the official SDK.
3. **Replicate Client (`src/replicate-client.ts`)**: Integrates with Replicate's API to generate images for product designs.

### Docker Architecture

The Docker setup consists of the following components:

1. **Dockerfile**: Defines how to build the Docker image
   - Uses Node.js 22 Alpine as the base image for a small footprint
   - Installs dependencies and builds the TypeScript code
   - Sets up the environment and runs the server

2. **docker-compose.yml**: Defines the service configuration
   - Sets up environment variables
   - Mounts volumes for .env file and temp directory
   - Configures stdin and tty for stdio transport
   - Sets restart policy

3. **Volumes**:
   - `.env`: Mounted as a read-only volume for environment variables
   - `temp`: Mounted as a volume for temporary files (like generated images)

### Publishing the Docker Image

You can publish the Docker image to Docker Hub or any other container registry to make it available to others without requiring them to install Node.js or clone the repository.

1. **Build the Docker image**:
   ```bash
   docker build -t tsavo/printify-mcp:latest .
   ```

2. **Log in to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker login
   ```

3. **Push the image to Docker Hub**:
   ```bash
   docker push tsavo/printify-mcp:latest
   ```

### Using the Docker Image Without Node.js

Users can run the Printify MCP server without installing Node.js by using the Docker image directly:

1. **Install Docker**: Users need to have Docker installed on their system

2. **Create a temp directory** for temporary files:
   ```bash
   mkdir -p temp
   ```

3. **Run the Docker container** (two options):

   **Option A: Using environment variables directly (Recommended)**
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name printify-mcp \
     -e PRINTIFY_API_KEY=their_printify_api_key \
     -e PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=their_shop_id_optional \
     -v $(pwd)/temp:/app/temp \
     tsavo/printify-mcp:latest
   ```

   **Note:** If they want to use the image generation features (generate-and-upload-image tool), add the Replicate API token:
   ```bash
   -e REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=their_replicate_api_token \
   ```

   **Option B: Using a .env file**
   First, create a .env file with their API keys:
   ```
   PRINTIFY_API_KEY=their_printify_api_key
   PRINTIFY_SHOP_ID=their_shop_id (optional)
   # Optional: Only needed if they want to use image generation features
   REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=their_replicate_api_token
   ```

   Then run the container:
   ```bash
   docker run -it --name printify-mcp \
     -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env:ro \
     -v $(pwd)/temp:/app/temp \
     tsavo/printify-mcp:latest
   ```

4. **Configure Claude Desktop**:
   - Open Claude Desktop
   - Go to Settings > MCP Servers
   - Click "Add Server"
   - Enter a name for the server (e.g., "Printify MCP Docker")
   - Select "Command" as the transport type
   - Enter `docker` as the command
   - Enter `exec -i printify-mcp node dist/index.js` as the arguments
   - Click "Add Server"

This approach allows users to run the Printify MCP server without installing Node.js or any other dependencies - they only need Docker.

- [replicate-client.ts Documentation](docs/replicate-client.ts.md)

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### Printify API Client Not Initialized

If you see the error "Printify API client is not initialized", check that:

1. The `PRINTIFY_API_KEY` environment variable is set correctly in your `.env` file
2. The API key is valid and has the correct permissions

#### Replicate API Client Not Initialized

If you see the error "Replicate API client is not initialized", check that:

1. The `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable is set correctly in your `.env` file
2. The API token is valid and has the correct permissions

#### Error Creating Product

If you encounter errors when creating a product, check that:

1. The blueprint ID and print provider ID are valid
2. The variant IDs are valid for the selected blueprint and print provider
3. The image IDs in print areas are valid and accessible
4. All required fields are included in the request

#### Error Uploading Image

If you encounter errors when uploading an image, check that:

1. The image is a valid format (PNG, JPEG, etc.)
2. The image is not too large (maximum size is 10MB)
3. If using a URL, it is publicly accessible
4. If using a local file, it exists and is readable

#### Docker-Specific Issues

If you're using the Docker setup and encounter issues:

1. **Container not starting**: Check Docker logs with `docker logs printify-mcp`
2. **Environment variables not working**: If using a .env file, make sure it's in the same directory as your docker-compose.yml file or the directory where you run the `docker run` command. If setting environment variables directly with `-e`, check for typos in variable names
3. **Permission issues with temp directory**: The temp directory is mounted as a volume, ensure it has the correct permissions
4. **Connection issues from Claude**: Make sure the Docker container is running with `docker ps` and that you've configured Claude Desktop correctly
5. **Image not found**: If using the Docker Hub image directly, make sure you've pulled it with `docker pull tsavo/printify-mcp:latest`

To restart the Docker container when using docker-compose:
```bash
docker-compose down
docker-compose up -d
```

To restart the Docker container when using docker run:
```bash
docker stop printify-mcp
docker rm printify-mcp
docker run -it --name printify-mcp -v $(pwd)/.env:/app/.env:ro -v $(pwd)/temp:/app/temp tsavo/printify-mcp:latest
```

For Windows users using PowerShell with the Docker image directly:
```powershell
docker run -it --name printify-mcp -v ${PWD}/.env:/app/.env:ro -v ${PWD}/temp:/app/temp tsavo/printify-mcp:latest
```

For Windows users using Command Prompt with the Docker image directly:
```cmd
docker run -it --name printify-mcp -v %cd%/.env:/app/.env:ro -v %cd%/temp:/app/temp tsavo/printify-mcp:latest
```

### Debugging

The server includes detailed logging to help troubleshoot issues. Check the console output for error messages and debugging information.

For Docker deployments, you can view logs with:
```bash
docker logs printify-mcp
```

To follow the logs in real-time:
```bash
docker logs -f printify-mcp
```
